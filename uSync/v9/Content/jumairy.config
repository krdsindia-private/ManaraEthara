      <Value Culture="en"><![CDATA[Born in Dubai in 1992, Jumairy uses experimentations with sound, film, digital technologies and performance to create immersive worlds composed of sensory experiences.

Traces and allusions more than closed, finite productions, these experiences occupy and transform spaces, becoming provocations that usher viewers from their present time and place into imagined realms.

These experiences accumulate to reveal and populate Jumairy’s world, an evolving and expansive space that is mapped through performative acts, scientific experiments and mysterious rituals taking place on stage, across the big screen and within smartphone apps.

The same prismatic approach structures his music, in which Arabic electro-pop is entwined with the discordant soundscape of industrial music.

Through this progressive and expansive mapping, Jumairy evolves, becoming a comprehensive conduit through which the artist explores psychological questions and processes traumas, both personal and collective.

Jumairy's work has been presented through residencies and exhibitions across the region and internationally. Most recently Jumairy has been selected as part of an international delegation of artists by The Sundance Institute.

A residency with FARE Arte (2017) resulted in 'BRZ5', Jumairy’s first solo exhibition in Milan, Italy. Most recently an exhibition titled 'Evaporating Suns’ curated by Munira Al Sayegh in Basel, Switzerland, an exhibition in Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia at Very.Public Studios (2023) titled ‘Heartache’ and in Islamabad, Pakistan at Dastaangoi Gallery (2022).

His work has also been featured in Art Dubai Art Fair multiple times the first in 2015/16 when he participated in the Art Dubai’s A.i.R. programme in collaboration with Delfina Foundation and Tashkeel, which culminated in an installation and performance work at the fair.

Jumairy’s work has been collected and supported by Barjeel Art Foundation, Jameel Art Centre, Maraya Art Centre and Farook Collection as well as being acquired by private collectors.]]></Value>
